# Contributing

In case you'd like to contribute, feel free to open an issue. If you want to fix the bug/implement the feature yourself, you can open a pull request afterwards.

The easiest way to contribute is adding new data sources (called "profiles" in the code base). Check [this file](/docs/adding-a-profile.md) to learn how to get started.
