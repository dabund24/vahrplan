# Contributing

Unfortunately, I can't accept large contributions at the moment because of the lack of tests (see [this issue](https://github.com/dabund24/vahrplan/issues/17)) and documentation (see [this issue](https://github.com/dabund24/vahrplan/issues/18)).

With that being said, if you have an idea on how to improve the app or if you found a bug, feel free to open an issue with the corresponding template (no matter how much knowledge is required to resolve it). If it turns out that the issue can be resolved in a simple way, you can fork the repository, commit your changes and open a pull request afterwards. :)
